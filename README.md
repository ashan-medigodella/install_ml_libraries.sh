# Machine Learning Libraries Overview

This repository provides a brief overview of several essential Python libraries commonly used in machine learning projects.

### Libraries Included:

- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **scikit-learn**: Simple and efficient tools for data mining and analysis, particularly for machine learning.
- **Matplotlib**: Comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **TensorFlow**: Open-source deep learning library developed by Google for building and training neural networks.
- **PyTorch**: Open-source deep learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab for building and training neural networks.
- **torchvision**: Part of the PyTorch library, providing datasets, transforms, and models specific to computer vision tasks.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK.

### Usage:

With these libraries installed, users will have the necessary tools to perform various machine learning tasks such as data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization. Additionally, Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive environment for writing and executing Python code, making it convenient for experimenting with machine learning algorithms and visualizing results.
